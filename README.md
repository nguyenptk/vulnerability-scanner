1. gateway using envoy proxy
    - POST /scan -H "token: $github_token"
    - /result -H "token: $github_token"
    - basic authentication (username/password) -> lua script (optional)
    - mediation -> rewrite path
2. scanning
    - authorize & clone github repos with token 
    - scan repos & write results to storage 
3. insight
    - read results from storage (replica - in case we want to deep-dive into the result)
4. storage
    - cache + database 
    - strategies:
        + check cache first
            - no cache -> read database -> add to cache -> return data
            - have cache -> return data from cache


5. Bug
    - multi repos: cannot find the vul
    - improve log format with x-request-id for debugging
