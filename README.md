## Vulnerability Scanner System
Vulnerability Scanner System is the microservices system that allow the user can scan, report the vulnerabilities of repositories in Github.
There are four parts:
- The API Gateway
- The Scanner
- The Insight
- The Storage

### Architecture

### 1. The API Gateway
The API Gateway is the gateway that exposes the APIs for client. It helps protect the internal services by Authentication, Ratelimit, etc. Therefore, in this case, the Scanner & Insight do not need to care more about the security or network traffic.

### 2. The Scanner
The Scanner is the core service of the system.
More details [here](/scanner/README.md).

### 3. The Insight
The Insight is the analytical service.

### 4. The Storage
The Storage holds the information of vulnerabilities that are inserted by The Scanner.
The Insight also uses it for analysis.

### Notes
#### There are a few bugs: 
- Multi repositories feature cannot find the vulnerabilities
- Improve the logic in creating a new report when there is a new scanning in the same repository.
