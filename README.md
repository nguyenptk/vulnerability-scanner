## Vulnerability Scanner System
Vulnerability Scanner System is the microservices system that allow the user can `scan` and `report` the vulnerabilities of repositories in Github.
There are four parts:
- The API Gateway
- The Scanner
- The Insight
- The Storage

### Architecture

### 1. The API Gateway
The API Gateway is the gateway that exposes the APIs for client. It helps protect the internal services by Authentication, Ratelimit, etc. Therefore, in this case, the Scanner & Insight do not need to care more about the security or network traffic.
More details [here](/api-gateway/README.md).

### 2. The Scanner
The Scanner is the core service of the system.
More details [here](/scanner/README.md).

### 3. The Insight
The Insight is the analytical service.
More details [here](/insight/README.md)

### 4. The Storage
The Storage holds the information of vulnerabilities that are inserted by The Scanner and The Insight also uses it for analysis.
More details [here](/storage/README.md).

## Notes
There are a few enhancement when I have time: 
- Multi repositories scanning feature cannot find the vulnerabilities.
- Improve the structs in the Scanner, they are too confused.
- You need to inject your $GITHUB_TOKEN to the header of `/scanner/v1/scan` or `/scan` API to scan the public and private repositories. I'm still investigating what the root cause is. Reference: [here](/scanner/README.md#2-private-repository)
