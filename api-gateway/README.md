## The API Gateway
The API Gateway is built on the Envoy Proxy https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy

## How it works
The API Gateway provides: 
- User Authentication with Oauth2, JWT,... 
- Ratelimit
- And a lot of other other awesome features
- ...(But not implemented yet) :smile:

And limited in this system, the API Gateway supports: 
- Mediation to rewrite from downstream request path to upstream service path.
- Request routing.
- Generate trusted x-request-id that helps manage the whole life of request in microservices.

## Notes
The API Gateway should have the API documentation for the user. But I do not have time to build the Swagger.
So you guys need to go the the [Scanner](/scanner/README.md) and [Insight](/insight/README.md) to see the tutorial of API calls.
