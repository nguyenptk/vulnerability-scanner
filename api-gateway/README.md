## The API Gateway
The API Gateway is built on the Envoy Proxy https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy

## How it works
The API Gateway provides: 
```
- User Authentication with Oauth2, JWT,... 
- Ratelimit
- A lot of other great features
- ...
(But not implemented yet)
```

And limited in this system, the API Gateway supports: 
- Mediation to rewrite from downstream request path to upstream service path.
- Request routing.
- Generate x-request-id that helps manage the whole life of request in microservices.

## Notes
The API Gateway should have the API documentations for the user. But I do not have time to build the Swagger.
So you guys need to go the the [Scanner](/scanner/README.md) and [Insight](/insight/README.md) to see the tutorial of API calls.
