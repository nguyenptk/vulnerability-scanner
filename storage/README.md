## Storage
Currently, the Storage only supports MySQL as a database.
I do not have enough time to build a cache layer (Redis) in front of the database.

## Schema
![Schemma](schemma.png)

- `reports`: holds the information of a scanning
- `vulnerabilities`: holds the information of a repository
- `findings`: holds the information of vulnerabilities

## phpMyAdmin
The Storage also supports a [friendly-UI](http://localhost:9090) at port 9090 for access MySQL.
